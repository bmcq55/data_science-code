#Part AÂ¶
#Find a list of all of the names in the following string using regex.

import re
def names():
    simple_string = """Amy is 5 years old, and her sister Mary is 2 years old. 
    Ruth and Peter, their parents, have 3 kids."""
    
    return(re.findall(r"[A-Z][a-z]+,?\w", simple_string))

print(names())

#Part B
#The dataset file in assets/grades.txt contains a line separated list of people with their grade in a class. Create a regex to generate a list of just those students who received a B in the course.

def grades():
    with open ("assets/grades.txt", "r") as file:
        grades = file.read()

#Part C
#Consider the standard web log file in assets/logdata.txt. This file records the access a user makes when visiting a web page (like this one!). Each line of the log has the following items:

#a host (e.g., '146.204.224.152')
#a user_name (e.g., 'feest6811' note: sometimes the user name is missing! In this case, use '-' as the value for the username.)
# the time a request was made (e.g., '21/Jun/2019:15:45:24 -0700')
# the post request type (e.g., 'POST /incentivize HTTP/1.1' note: not everything is a POST!)
# Your task is to convert this into a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary looks like the following:

# example_dict = {"host":"146.204.224.152", 
#                 "user_name":"feest6811", 
#                 "time":"21/Jun/2019:15:45:24 -0700",
#                 "request":"POST /incentivize HTTP/1.1"}
